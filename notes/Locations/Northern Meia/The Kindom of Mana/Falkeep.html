<p>Falkeep is a small agrarian village along the highway near Thunderwharf.</p>

<p>It is about a days travel away from the city, and as such is a common stopover point.</p>

<p>The town itself is built amongst the walls of an ancient fort built by House Callow in approximately 850BC (~1050 years ago). Legends say that the fort lasted through only one Winter before the nobles fled for an unknown reason and the castle began to collapse.</p>

<p>The town has an inn, butcher, baker and blacksmith, as well as numerous other small trade stores, but the majority of the town are farmers and hunters.</p>

<p>The town is surrounded by the Falwode, which is an ancient but quite small forest that runs along the side of Thunderlake. The citizens of the town have a ritual in which they give sacrifices to the forest at the end of each winter, though the exact specifics of the ritual are not shared with outsiders. This ritual is led by a local witch, who is always trained by the previous witch.</p>

<p>Due to superstition, the town does not usually see new settlers of families that do not already have deep roots in the town, and as such it has remained quite small, despite being so close to a major city.</p>

<p>Lady Callow, the local baroness, refuses to enter the town to collect taxes, and instead insists that the townsfolke bring their taxes out into the highway for collection.</p>
